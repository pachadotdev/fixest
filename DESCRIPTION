Description: Fast and user-friendly estimation of generalized linear models with
    multiple fixed effects and cluster the standard errors. The method to obtain
    the estimated fixed-effects coefficients is based on Berge (2018) 
    <https://ideas.repec.org//p/luc/wpaper/18-13.html>,
    Correia(2016)
    <http://scorreia.com/research/hdfe.pdf>, and
    Gaure (2013)
    <https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2013.03.024>. The codebase uses
    vendoring, therefore the dependency code is fixed and stable until it is 
    updated.
