â„¹ Loading fixest2
(Permanently remove the following message with fixest_startup_msg(FALSE).)
fixest 0.10.0:
- vcov: new argument 'vcov' that replaces 'se' and 'cluster' in all functions
(retro compatibility is ensured).
- Breaking: arg. 'vcov' now comes after 'data'/'family', hence code using an
offset w/t the arg. name may break (just use 'offset = stuff' now).
- function 'dof()' has been renamed into 'ssc()' (i.e. small sample correction).
From fixest 0.9.0 onward: BREAKING changes! 
- In i():
    + the first two arguments have been swapped! Now it's i(factor_var,
    continuous_var) for interactions.
    + argument 'drop' has been removed (put everything in 'ref' now).
- In feglm(): 
    + the default family becomes 'gaussian' to be in line with glm(). Hence, for
    Poisson estimations, please use fepois() instead.
